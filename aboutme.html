<h1>Favorite Subject</h1>
<p>My favorite subject is science becuase I find it as a fun subject and 
vey interesting and also it teaches you a lot and I love learning things 
about the earth and the world. I find things interesting when it comes to
science. Scienece to me is one of the classes I always wanna have a good
grade in. One of my goals is one day I become a scientist and a lot of new
things around the world. Science also teaches me a lot in life.</p>

    of me because they want me to accomplish something like this.</p>
